## Overview
In **Astro Cats**, you control a cat who travels through space and a newly discovered **Doughnut Farm**. Space is filled with surprises—while some objects boost your score or replenish your lives, others can bring your adventure to an end. Explore new mechanics like doughnut upgrades and the **dimensional portal**!

## Gameplay
### Roam Around  
- Move through a **vibrant space environment** and **explore the Doughnut Farm**.

### Collect & Upgrade Objects
- **Red Fish**: Earn 1 point per red fish collected.  
- **Egg-like Objects**: These rare items grant **10 points** and can **replenish your lives**.  
- **Doughnuts**: Collected from the Doughnut Farm and used as **ammunition**.  
  - **Upgrading Doughnuts** (Press `M`):  
    - **Level 1**: Seedling (plain brown)  
    - **Level 2**: Sprout (brown with chocolate glaze)  
    - **Level 3**: Final product (pink with sprinkles, ready for collection & ammo)  

### Avoid Hazards
- **Meteorites**: Getting hit by a meteorite will cause you to lose a life.  
- **White Fish**: Colliding with a white fish also reduces your life count.  
- **Alien Enemy**: Found in space—use doughnuts to **attack** or **reflect meteorites into them** for extra damage.  

### Dimensional Portal  
- Travel between **space and the Doughnut Farm** to grow doughnuts and return to battle enemies.
